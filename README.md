# C# Dictionary Journey

Welcome to the C# Dictionary Journey! This project is a collection of C# code examples demonstrating different techniques for working with dictionaries. We created this repo to help understand and learn how to use dictionaries in C#.

## What is this Project About?

This project is a collection of C# code examples demonstrating different techniques for working with dictionaries. The examples are organized into sections covering:
- basic operations
- iterating dictionaries
- dictionary operations
- nested dictionaries
- custom key types
- concurrent dictionaries
- advanced dictionary techniques(LRU Cache and Conditional Weak Table).

## How to Use this Project

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `CSharpDictionaryJourney` solution in Visual Studio.
3. In the `Program.cs` file, you'll see that the `Main` method calls the methods from different classes. These methods demonstrate the concepts covered in the different sections of the project.
4. To run the examples, press `F5` or click the `Start` button in Visual Studio.
5. The console application will run and display the output for each example.

## What's Next?
