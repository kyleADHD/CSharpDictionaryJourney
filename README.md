## CSharpDictionaryJourney

This repository covers comprehensive techniques for handling dictionaries in C#. It introduces various modules that delve deep into operations, iterations, concurrency, and advanced techniques.

### Modules Overview:

1. **Dictionary Introduction:**
   - **Basic Declaration:** How to initialize a dictionary and add/remove elements.
   - **Access Methods:** Access values through indexers and `TryGetValue()`.

2. **Dictionary Iteration:**
   - **Foreach Iteration:** Loop through key-value pairs using `foreach`.
   - **Custom Loops:** Manual iteration with `LoopWithDictionaries`.

3. **Dictionary Operations:**
   - **Merging:** Combine multiple dictionaries into one.
   - **Sorting:** Arrange entries based on keys or values.
   - **Grouping:** Group entries by specified criteria.

4. **Nested Dictionaries:**
   - **Creation:** How to define dictionaries within dictionaries.
   - **Access:** Methods to navigate through nested structures.
   - **Operations:** Perform various manipulations.

5. **Custom Key Types:**
   - **Creating Dictionaries:** Use custom types as dictionary keys.

6. **Concurrent Dictionaries:**
   - **Concurrency:** Use dictionaries in a thread-safe manner.

7. **Advanced Dictionary Techniques:**
   - **Weak Tables:** Use conditional weak tables to manage dictionary memory.
   - **LRU Cache:** Implement a Least Recently Used cache mechanism.
