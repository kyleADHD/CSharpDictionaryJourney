## Iterating Dictionaries

Welcome to the Iterating Dictionaries section! In this part, we'll learn how to iterate through C# dictionaries using different techniques. We'll cover using a foreach loop with KeyValuePair, filtering or transforming dictionary contents with LINQ, and iterating dictionary keys and values separately.

### Topics Covered

1. Using foreach loop with KeyValuePair
2. Using LINQ to filter or transform dictionary contents
3. Iterating dictionary keys and values separately

### How to Run the Examples

1. Open the `CSharpDictionaryJourney` solution in Visual Studio.
2. In the `Program.cs` file, you'll see that the `Main` method calls the methods from the `DictionaryIteration` class. These methods demonstrate the concepts covered in this section.
3. To run the examples, press `F5` or click the `Start` button in Visual Studio.
4. The console application will run and display the output for each example.

Keep exploring and learning! We'll dive into more advanced topics in the upcoming sections. Enjoy!
